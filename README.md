# Multi-threaded Ticket Sellers  
This project will give you experience writing a multithreaded program using C or C++  and the Pthreads library. Write a program that simulates ticket sellers simultaneously  selling concert tickets during one hour. 
 
Suppose there are 100 seats  available to a concert. One ticket seller named H sells high-priced tickets, three ticket sellers named  M1, M2, and  M3  sell medium-priced tickets, and six ticket sellers named  L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, and  L6  sell low-priced tickets.  Each ticket  seller has a separate customer queue.  All the ticket sellers work simultaneously during one hour.  Each seller can expect N customers  to arrive at random times during the hour, where  N  is a command-line  parameter. Each seller serves customer in the order that they arrive in  
his ticket queue.  

For simplicity, your program will keep track of time in units of a minute. Therefore,  customers  arrive only at the start of a minute. High-price ticket customers get the fastest  service, and each requires randomly exactly  1 or 2 minutes  to complete a ticket sale.  Medium-price ticket customers each requires randomly  exactly  2, 3, or 4 minutes  to  complete a sale. Low-price ticket customers each requires randomly exactly  4, 5, 6, or 7  minutes to complete a sale. All ten ticket sellers work collaboratively. When a seller serves a customer, the first thing  the seller does is check to see if any  seats are available, and if so, the seller assigns a  seat to the customer and then completes the ticket purchase using the required amount  of time.  Ensure that two sellers don’t assign the same seat to two different customers. The concert has  ten rows of  seats  with  ten seats  in each row. The high-priced seller assigns seats starting with row 1 (the front) and works towards the back. The low-priced  sellers assigns seats starting with row 10 (the back) and works towards the front. The middle-priced sellers start with row 5, then row 6, then row 4, then row 7, etc.  

# Your  Program Output  
Your program should print a line indicating each event as it occurs. 

### An event is:  
- A customer arrives at the tail of a seller’s queue.  
-   A customer is served and is assigned a seat, or is told the concert is sold out, in which case the customer immediately leaves.  
-   A customer completes a ticket purchase and leaves.  
-   In addition, your program should compute 
	-  the  Average response time per customer for a given seller type
	-  average  turn-around time  per customer for a given seller type
	-  average throughput  per seller type  

Start each event print line with a time stamp, such as 0:05, 0:12, etc. 

##
 
After each ticket sale, also print the concert seating chart as a 10-by-10 matrix that  
shows which customer was assigned to each seat. Identify ticket seller H’s customers as  H001,  H002,  H003, ...; the customers of ticket sellers  M1, M2, ..., as M101,  M102, ...,  M201,  M202, ...; and the customers of ticket sellers L1, L2, ... as  L101,  L102, ...,  L201,  L202, ... 

You can indicate still-unsold seats with dashes.  

At the end of one hour, each ticket seller should complete whatever purchase may still  be in progress and close the ticket window. Any remaining customers in the queues  should leave immediately. Of course, if the concert sells out before the hour is up, all the  ticket windows should close after the last seat is taken.  

Write  your program in  C or C++ using the Pthreads library.  

Run your program for N  = 5, 10, and 15 customers per ticket seller, where N is a  command-line parameter.

At the end of each run, print how many H, M, and L  customers got seats, how many  customers were turned away, etc.
